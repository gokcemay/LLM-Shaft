This is a simple test for Mechanical Engineering students and professionals to showcase the capabilities of LLMs in design automation. In this case LLM was used only for code generation. 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various do-
mains. While specialized machine learning algorithms exist for mechanical de-
sign, the potential of general-purpose LLMs like Google Gemini in this field
remains underexplored. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing such
an LLM to develop a simplified script for shaft design, given user-specified loads
and distances. For this initial exploration, material properties were held con-
stant. The generated shaft design is then translated into a CAD file using the
Fusion 360 API in Python.
